# Sam Hinshaw's Blog

This is the GitHub repository & staging area for my jekyll blog at [blog.samhinshaw.com](https://blog.samhinshaw.com). I am creating this GitHub repository in order to test build & deployment automation. Should all go well, I will implement a similar method with my main site, but add in a staging area for my development branch at [dev.samhinshaw.com](https://dev.samhinshaw.com).

This blog was created using the [Strata Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/CloudCannon/Strata-Jekyll-Theme), which was in turn adapted from Strata by HTML5 UP by [Comfusion LLC](http://comfusionllc.com). I have modified some aspects of this theme for personal use.
